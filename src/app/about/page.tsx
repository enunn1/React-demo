        I was born in Rock Island, IL, and raised in Cottage Grove, MN. My interest in computers and technology began early and quickly grew into a lifelong passion. What started as a childhood hobby eventually became my careerâ€”I earned an Associate&apos;s degree in Computer Programming followed by a Bachelor&apos;s in Computer Science, graduating with high honors from both.<br/><br/>
        Today, I&apos;m a Software Engineer with hands-on experience in full-stack web development, cloud platforms, and Agile methodologies. At Optum, I contributed to building secure and scalable web applications using modern technologies like React.js, Next.js, Angular, and Spring Boot. I&apos;ve worked extensively in cloud environments, deploying applications to Microsoft Azure and leveraging tools like Kubernetes and Kafka to manage and optimize data workflows.<br/><br/>
        I&apos;m a Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals holder with a strong focus on clean code, CI/CD practices, security mitigation, and team collaboration. Whether it&apos;s refining legacy systems or building new features from the ground up, I enjoy solving complex problems and constantly improving my craft.
